[Active Directory Integration / LDAP Integration](https://plugins.miniorange.com/step-by-step-guide-for-wordpress-ldap-login-cloud?utm_source=wordpress%20readme&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=Active%20Directory/LDAP%20Integration%20for%20Cloud%20&%20Shared%20Hosting%20Platforms) allows you to log in to your WordPress site hosted on any cloud / shared hosting platforms such as Hostinger, Bluehost, DreamHost, HostGator, GreenGeeks, SiteGround, A2 Hosting, Flywheel, WPEngine, Kinsta, GoDaddy by using the credentials stored in your Active Directories such as Microsoft Active Directory, Azure Active Directory, OpenLDAP Directory, Sun Active Directory, JumpCloud,  FreeIPA Directory, Synology, OpenDS or other LDAP directories. This LDAP / AD Integration (Active Directory Integration) plugin does not require you to have the LDAP extension enabled and is a safe way of performing authentication for your WordPress site.

**How can we Integrate LDAP/Active Directory with WordPress Shared Hosting?**
Integrating LDAP/Active Directory with a WordPress shared hosting platform is simple by using the miniOrange LDAP Integration plugin. This plugin enables users to log in securely using credentials from LDAP directories such as Microsoft Active Directory, Azure AD, and OpenLDAP, without requiring the PHP LDAP extension. After installing the plugin, configure your Active directory settings, map LDAP attributes to WordPress user profiles, and authenticate users from multiple Active directories for seamless and secure access to your WordPress site.

= Features:- =

* Perform LDAP / Active Directory Login (AD Login) into your WordPress website hosted on a shared hosting environment/cloud platform using Active Directory / other LDAP directory credentials.
* Supports LDAP / Active Directory authentication for WordPress site(s) hosted on Cloud / Shared Hosting Platforms such as Hostinger, Bluehost, DreamHost, HostGator, GreenGeeks, SiteGround, A2 Hosting, Flywheel, WPEngine, Kinsta, GoDaddy, etc.
* No Need to install/configure any additional extension (like PHP LDAP extension) on the cloud / shared hosting platform to facilitate a connection to the Active Directory / other LDAP directory.
* <strong>Automatic User Registration in WordPress:</strong> Automatically register LDAP/Active Directory user(s) in your WordPress website after a successful LDAP / AD login.
* <strong>Multiple Search Containers: </strong>Authenticate users against multiple search bases from your LDAP Active Directory / any other LDAP directory.

* <strong>Advanced Attribute Mapping: </strong>Map user profile information to be retrieved from Active Directory / other LDAP directory. eg: first name, last name, phone number, email, etc. Configure any LDAP / AD attribute such as givenname, sn, uid, mail, telephone number, department, company, sAMAccountName, UserPrincipalName, etc, to WordPress user profile attributes.
* <strong>Redirect to custom URL after WordPress LDAP authentication: </strong>Our LDAP Active Directory Integration plugin for Cloud & Shared Hosting Platforms allows you to redirect users to a WordPress Profile page, Home page, or any other Custom URL after successful LDAP authentication from your Active Directory / other LDAP directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=Does the LDAP Integration plugin require installing the PHP LDAP extension on my cloud or shared hosting platform?=
No, the plugin does not require installing or configuring the PHP LDAP extension on your hosting platform. It connects securely to your Active Directories, such as Active Directory, without needing extra extensions.

=What types of LDAP attributes can be mapped to WordPress profiles?=
The plugin allows mapping LDAP/Active Directory attributes such as sAMAccountName, UID, UserPrincipalName, email, and custom attributes to WordPress user profiles. These attributes can also be automatically updated upon login.

=Can I assign WordPress roles based on LDAP group memberships?=
Yes, the plugin supports role mapping, where LDAP group memberships or organizational units (OUs) in the directory can be mapped to specific WordPress roles. This allows you to control user roles dynamically upon authentication.

=Is there support for multiple LDAP/Active Directory integrations in the plugin?=
Yes, the plugin offers support for multiple LDAP or Active Directory integrations, including authentication from multiple directories. This feature is available in the premium version of the plugin.

=What kind of support does miniOrange provide for the LDAP/Active Directory Integration plugin?=
miniOrange offers 24/7 active support, including help with plugin configuration and debugging. Additionally, they provide extensive documentation, YouTube setup tutorials, and email support at ldapsupport@xecurify.com.


= How should I enter my LDAP configuration? I only see Register with miniOrange. =
Our very simple and easy registration lets you register with miniOrange. Our LDAP Active Directory Integration plugin for Cloud and Shared Hosting Platforms works if you are connected to miniOrange. Once you have registered with a valid email address and phone number, you will be able to add your Active Directory / LDAP directory configuration.

= I am not able to get the configuration right. =
Make sure that if there is a firewall, you `OPEN THE FIREWALL` to allow incoming requests to your Active Directory / LDAP Directory. Please open port 389(636 for SSL or ldaps). Host - 52.55.147.107 - This is the host from where the Active Directory / LDAP connection, as well as authentication requests, are going to be made. For further help, please click on the Troubleshooting button. Check the steps to see what you could have missed. If that does not help, please check the format of the demo settings. You can copy them over using `Copy Default Config`.

= I am locked out of my account and can't log in with either my WordPress credentials or LDAP credentials. What should I do? =
Firstly, please check if the `user you are trying to login with` exists in your WordPress. To unlock yourself, rename miniorange-wp-ldap-login plugin name. You will be able to login with your WordPress credentials. After logging in, rename the plugin back to miniorange-wp-ldap-login. If the problem persists, `activate, deactivate and again activate` the plugin.

= LDAP / Active Directory configurations are correct and test authentication is also working but the active directory login is not working on the website. =
Please make sure that the active directory login is enabled. You can check this by going to the <strong>"Sign-In Settings"</strong> Tab. The <strong>"Enable LDAP login"</strong> checkbox should be checked. This will enable users to use Active Directory login / LDAP Login on the WordPress website.

= I am not able to connect my AD / LDAP Server over LDAPS connection.
Follow our <a href="https://www.miniorange.com/guide-to-setup-ldaps-on-windows-server" target="_blank">step by step guide</a> to enable LDAPS on your Active Directory and download the LDAPS certificate of your AD.
